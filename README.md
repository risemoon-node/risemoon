- 💬 **What is RISE?**
  - RISE offers a platform for Decentralized Applications (DAPPs), powered by a community driven Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain.
...
- ⚡ **Decentralized Distributed Applications**
  - Applications built on RISE will be both distributed and decentralized, as a copy of the blockchain will reside on multiple nodes and if one node fails the network can still operate. Each DAPP created with RISE development tools will run on RISE sidechain technology connecting to the mainchain.
...
- 😄 **Developer Tools**
  - RISE aims to offer developers Software Development Kits (SDKs) to enable the creation of Decentralized Applications (DAPPs). Developers will also be able to interact with the RISE blockchain through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in multiple code languages such as TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, C# and JAVA.
